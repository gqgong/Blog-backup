>作业：

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the documentation, I got a lot. I have a new understanding of computer vision, and understand the role of computer vision in the field of transportation and its potential value in the field of geographic information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above,all,in the digital infrastructure of the future,intelligent transport systems and edge computing is one of part.Applications that extract moving objects in street view for navigation, autonomous decision-making and safety will have the ability to perceive the environment around itself. Therefore, any autonomous system will require to process the data it captures locally which makes edge computing a mission-critical enabling technology for successfulI TS.Putsimply,Artificial Intelligence refers to a variety of algorithmically trained computing models such as machine learning,natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision that are being applied to various geospatial applications ranging from object recognition to real-time motion detection. Although the next chapter will address Artificial Intelligence and machine learning more thoroughly, it is notable that in the case of CAVs navigation and objectrecognition data need to be processed locallyas latency, distance and the unpredict ability of connectivity would prohibit safety and autonomous decision-making if conducted in the cloud.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course,with the rise of Artiﬁcial Intelligence,Big Data and data analytics，there are many  potentials of Artificial Intelligence in geospatial production.There have been marked improvements in computer vision functions such as image classification and object recognition.Early applications include disaster risk response scenarios. Providing timely, dynamic and accurate mapping solutions are crucial in preparation, response and recovery phase of disasters; yet, the nature of disasters due to their scale and volatility have proven achallenge. Initiatives like the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team increasingly apply computer vision techniques to speed up and improve the accuracy of mapping data generation and dissemination delivering up-to-date maps for vastgeo graphic territories.
